### Hi there 👋

I'm focusing on WordPress block themes. I'm using mostly only core blocks, CSS and only a very limited amount of JS and PHP.

I built my first website in 2000 and have been passionate about web design ever since. I'm a design graduate with extensive experience in web design and branding and I worked as a project manager in design agencies for international automotive companies. My unique strength is combining solid design expertise with a deep understanding of development. I'm proficient in Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, HTML, CSS, SCSS, and WordPress block theme development. I'm fluent in both German and English.

I'm a freelancer and run my own agency. Hit me up if you want to collaborate!

- 🌍 I’m working remotly, currently in Europe.
- 👨‍💻 I'm available for freelance web design jobs.
