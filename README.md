### Hi there 👋

I build custom WordPress block themes for businesses and enterprises, sticking as closely as possible to WordPress core and relying primarily on clean CSS with minimal JavaScript and PHP.

Web design has been my passion since I launched my first site in 2000. After earning a graphic design degree in Germany (and exchange year in England), I worked as a project manager at a leading design agency, working with  international design teams of global automotive brands.

Today I'm a freelancer, combining my design expertise with development knowledge. I'm proficient in WordPress block theme development, Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, HTML, CSS/SCSS, and fluent in German and English. 
I create elegant, structured and high-perfomant websites.

Need support or consulting? Let’s collaborate!

- 🌍 I’m working remotly, currently in Europe.
- 👨‍💻 I'm available for freelance web design jobs.
